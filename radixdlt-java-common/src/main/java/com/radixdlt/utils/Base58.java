/**
 * Base58 is a way to encode Bitcoin addresses (or arbitrary data) as alphanumeric strings.
 *
 * <p>Note that this is not the same base58 as used by Flickr, which you may find referenced around
 * the Internet.
 *
 * <p>You may want to consider working with {@link PrefixedChecksummedBytes} instead, which adds
 * support for testing the prefix and suffix bytes commonly found in addresses.
 *
 * <p>Satoshi explains: why base-58 instead of standard base-64 encoding?
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Don't want 0OIl characters that look the same in some fonts and could be used to create
 *       visually identical looking account numbers.
 *   <li>A string with non-alphanumeric characters is not as easily accepted as an account number.
 *   <li>E-mail usually won't line-break if there's no punctuation to break at.
 *   <li>Doubleclicking selects the whole number as one word if it's all alphanumeric.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>However, note that the encoding/decoding runs in O(n&sup2;) time, so it is not useful for
 * large data.
 *
 * <p>The basic idea of the encoding is to treat the data bytes as a large number represented using
 * base-256 digits, convert the number to be represented using base-58 digits, preserve the exact
 * number of leading zeros (which are otherwise lost during the mathematical operations on the
 * numbers), and finally represent the resulting base-58 digits as alphanumeric ASCII characters.
 *
 * <p>Note: This code is subject to the license noted in the header comment and was taken from the
 * bitcoinj library available on <a
 * href="https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/bitcoinj/core/Base58.java">
 * Github</a>.
